                                            Hiking Little Adam’s Peak in Sri Lanka is one of the most epic things to do
                                            in Ella.As is obvious by the name, this is a smaller version of the famous
                                            Adam's Peak of Nuwara Eliya. This particular trek takes around 2-3 hours, as
                                            this stands at 2,243m.
                                            <br><br>
                                            The best time to hike Little Adams Peak is in the early morning. It’s best
                                            to start the hike when it’s still dark, so that when you get to the top you
                                            can experience one incredible Little Adam’s Peak sunrise.

                                            Little Adams Peak is the most accessible hike in Ella and well worth

                                            The other most famous attraction in Ella is the Nine Arch Bridge. This
                                            gorgeous bridge is surrounded by lush greenery and tea fields and has become
                                            the postcard of Sri Lanka.
                                            <br><br>
                                            The Nine Arches forms a viaduct between the Demodara and Ella Railway
                                            stations. Built entirely out of brick, rock and cement; without a single
                                            piece of steel; the bridge has stood solid from 1921, its time of creation.
                                            According to history, the bridge was built by the locals using such
                                            materials; when the construction came to a standstill from the lack of steel
                                            caused by World War I.
                                            <br><br>
                                            The Nine Arch Bridge, also known as the ‘Bridge in the Sky’ was constructed
                                            by connecting two bog mountains when constructing the Badulla – Colombo
                                            railway. This bridge is 300 feet in length, 25 feet in width and 80-100 feet
                                            in height. It is one of the best examples of colonial-era railway
                                            construction in the country.The Bridge can be reached by travelling 2km on
                                            Gotuwala road starting from Halpe Textile centre in Badulla Bandarawela
                                            road.The surrounding area has seen a steady increase in tourism due to the
                                            bridge’s architectural ingenuity and the profuse greenery in the nearby
                                            hillsides.
