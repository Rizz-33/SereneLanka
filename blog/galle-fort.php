                                        Galle Fort, also known as Dutch Fort, on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, was
                                        established first by the Portuguese in 1588, then heavily fortified by the Dutch
                                        in the 17th century beginning in 1649, making it one of the most important
                                        archeological, architectural and historic monuments to illustrate the European
                                        influence in South East Asia between the 16th and 19th centuries.According to a
                                        statement by UNESCO,was recognized as a <a href="">UNESCO World
                                            Heritage</a> site for its unique exposition of an urban ensemble which
                                        illustrates the interaction of European architecture and South Asian traditions
                                        from the 16th to the 19th centuries which is criterion number four for such
                                        recognition.

                                            Galle’s earliest historical existence is traced to Ptolemy’s world map of
                                            125–150 CE when it was a busy port, trading with Greece, Arab countries,
                                            China and others. Its mention as a "port of call of the Levant" is made in
                                            the cosmography of Cosmas Indicopleustes. This is the harbour where the
                                            Portuguese, under the leadership of Lourenço de Almeida, made their first
                                            landing in 1505 on the island and caused a notable change in developments on
                                            the island with their close friendship with Dharmaparakrama Bahu
                                            (1484–1514), the then king of the country. Before the Portuguese arrived
                                            here, Ibn Batuta had touched base at this port. This was the beginning of
                                            the fort’s history, which was built by the Portuguese, along with a
                                            Franciscan chapel (now mostly in ruins) inside the fort in 1541.
                                            <br><br>
                                            The fort also, in later years, served as a prison camp to incarcerate
                                            Sinhalese natives who opposed the Portuguese. The Portuguese had moved to
                                            Colombo from Galle as they preferred the latter. In 1588, however, they were
                                            attacked by the Sinhalese King Raja Singha I (1581–93) of Sitawaka, which
                                            forced the Portuguese to return to Galle. At Galle, they initially built a
                                            small fort out of palm trees and mud. They called it the Santa Cruz and
                                            later extended it with a watch tower and three bastions and a "fortalice" to
                                            guard the harbour.

                                            Other prominent landmarks in Galle include the city's natural harbour, the
                                            National Maritime Museum, St. Mary's Cathedral founded by Jesuit priests,
                                            one of the main Shiva temples on the island, and Amangalla, the historic
                                            luxury hotel. On 26 December 2004, the city was devastated by the massive
                                            tsunami caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, which occurred off the
                                            coast of Indonesia a thousand miles away. Thousands were killed in the city
                                            alone. Galle is home to the Galle International Stadium, which is considered
                                            to be one of the most picturesque cricket grounds in the world.The ground,
                                            which was severely damaged by the tsunami, was rebuilt and test matches
                                            resumed there on 18 December 2007.

                                            Important natural geographical features in Galle include Rumassala in
                                            Unawatuna, a large mound-like hill that forms the eastern protective barrier
                                            to Galle Harbour. Local tradition associates this hill with some events of
                                            Ramayana, one of the great Hindu epics. The major river in the area is the
                                            Gin Ganga, which begins from Gongala Kanda, passes villages such as Neluwa,
                                            Nagoda, Baddegama, Thelikada and Wakwella, and reaches the sea at Gintota.
                                            The river is bridged at Wakwella by the Wakwella Bridge.

                                            However, today, the fort has been transformed into a place of history,
                                            romance and beauty where travellers are warmly welcomed to dive head first
                                            into the exotic stories and be a part of this heritage site.
