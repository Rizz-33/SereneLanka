                                            To reach World's End, one must embark on a picturesque hike through the
                                            Horton Plains. The journey commences in the early hours of the morning,
                                            adding an element of mystery as the mist clings to the ground, creating an
                                            ethereal ambiance. The well-maintained trails guide visitors through verdant
                                            grasslands, dense forests, and crystal-clear streams, granting glimpses of
                                            the park's rich wildlife, including various species of birds, deer, and even
                                            the elusive leopard.

                                            As the trek progresses, the surroundings gradually change, and the air
                                            becomes cooler and crisper, heightening the sense of anticipation. The path
                                            leads to the cliff's edge, where an open, windswept plateau appears. It is
                                            here that World's End reveals its majesty. The sheer drop plunges into a
                                            dense forest-covered valley below, creating a striking contrast between the
                                            lush greenery and the rugged precipice.

                                        The best time to visit World's End is during the dry season, which typically
                                        spans from January to March when the skies are clear, and visibility is at its
                                        peak. However, the weather in the central highlands can be unpredictable, and
                                        visitors are advised to be prepared for sudden changes in temperature and misty
                                        conditions, which can add an enigmatic charm to the experience.

                                        forest paths of the park also provide a serene escape from the hustle and bustle
