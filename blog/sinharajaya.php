                                        Sinharaja, a virgin, age-old rainforest, is not without its vivid past. The name
                                        translates to "Kingdom of the Lion," and according to mythology, Sri Lankans are
                                        the descendants of a princess and the lion king who lived in this forest.Being
                                        one of the last remaining and least disturbed biodiversity hotspots in Sri
                                        Lanka, the Sinharaja Rainforest was designated a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in
                                        1978 and then a <a href="">UNESCO World
                                            Heritage</a> Site in 1988,because of its unique and high biodiversity. It is
                                        Sri Lanka's first nature reserve to earn this esteemed distinction.

                                            The History of Sinharaja forest goes around millions of years ago as it is
                                            evident in its rare and native species of animals which you will come across
                                            your hike in this trip. The name Sinharaja suggests it was a royal forest
                                            since the period of the monarchical reign of various kings of this land.
                                            <br><br>
                                            Because of the rare autochthonous species found in its environment, the
                                            unique ecological variety blazing on this territory has earned it various
                                            titles from national and international organizations. Witness the towering
                                            trees, colorful birds, and fascinating animals within the evergreen forest,
                                            which is accessible from a variety of entry points in the north, south, and
                                            west.
                                            <br><br>
                                            This unique forest covers an area of approximately 11,200 hectares,
                                            measuring 21 kilometers from east to west and just less than 4 kilometers
                                            from north to south. Situated in the south-west lowland wet zone of Sri
                                            Lanka and falling into the Sabaragamuwa and Southern provinces, Sinharaja is
                                            surrounded by Napola Dola, Koskulana Ganga (north), Maha Dola, Gin Ganga

                                        As a rainforest with its rich and complex diversity of vegetation, Sinharaja
                                        provides habitats for a variety of animals. Although dependent on plants for
                                        food, animals also carry out certain functions vital to the growth of some
                                        plants. Pollination and seed dispersal are two of these.Sinharaja has two main
                                        forest types. One is the Dipterocarpus forests that occur in the valleys and on
                                        their lower slopes. Here almost pure stands of Hora (Dipterocarpus. Zeylanicus)
                                        and Bu Hora (Dipterocarpus. Hispidus) can be seen.

                                            The secondary forest and scrub that currently exists where the original
                                            forest cover has been destroyed by shifting cultivation or other tree
                                            clearance operations is the other forest type. Rubber and tea plantations
                                            have replaced the forest in other areas. The climax vegetation of the
                                            reserve, Mesua-Doona (Shorea) forest, covers the middle and upper slopes
                                            above 500m.

                                            Sinharaja has the benefit of both monsoons. Rainfalls are regular during the
                                            south-west monsoons, May-July, the north-east monsoons and November-January,
                                            except February when the conditions are dry.

                                            Sinharaja is the country's last sustainable region of primary tropical
                                            rainforest, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature
                                            (IUCN). More than 60% of the trees are endemic, and many are endangered. 50%
                                            of Sri Lanka's indigenous animal species (especially butterflies,
                                            amphibians, mammals, birds, snakes, and fish species) It is home to 95% of
