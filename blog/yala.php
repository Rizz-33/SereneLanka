                                    <p>
                                        Yala National Park (also known as Ruhuna National Park)is the most visited and
                                        second largest national park in Sri Lanka, bordering the Indian Ocean.Yala is
                                        one of Sri Lanka’s oldest national parks and was designated a wildlife sanctuary
                                        as far back as 1900 though it wasn’t until 1938 that it was established as a
                                        national park. Right in the heart of Yala sits the Buddhist temple Sithulpawa,
                                        and this former monastery is thought to date back 2,000 years. At one time, the
                                        monastery is thought to have housed 12,000 inhabitants, and today, it remains an
                                        important temple visited by pilgrims across Sri Lanka. Other significant
                                        cultural sites in the vicinity include Kataragama and Magul Maha Vihara.

                                            Yala covers an area of 1,260 square kilometres and is divided into five
                                            blocks, two of which are now open to the public; and also adjoining parks.
                                            It is in the southeast region of the country, and lies in Southern Province
                                            and Uva Province. The park covers 979 km² (378 sq mi) and is about 300 km

                                            Yala was declared as a wildlife sanctuary in 1900, and it was one of the
                                            first two national parks in Sri Lanka, along with Wilpattu, in 1938. The
                                            park is most recognized for its diverse collection of exotic animals. It is
                                            critical for the survival of Sri Lankan elephants and aquatic birds.

                                            Yala is located in Sri Lanka's lowest peneplain, which stretches from
                                            Trincomalee to Hambantota.Topographically the area is a flat and mildly
                                            undulating plain that runs to the coast with elevation is 30 metres (98 ft)
                                            close to the coast while rising in the interior to 100–125 metres (330–410
                                            ft).The national park is located in a dry semi-arid climate, with rain
                                            falling primarily during the northeast monsoon.The average annual rainfall
                                            is 500-775 millimetres (20-30.5 in), and the average temperature ranges from
                                            26.4°C (79.5°F) in January to 30 °C (86 °F) in April. Wind speeds range from
                                            23 km/h (14 mph) to 15 km/h in Yala during the southwest monsoon compared to
                                            the northeast monsoon.

                                        Yala National Park is the best reserve in Sri Lanka for seeing a wide variety of
                                        wildlife, and in particular leopards, elephants and sloth bears. There are
                                        approximately 215 bird species resident in the park, including seven endemics,
                                        along with 44 mammals. The park is divided into five blocks of which block I
                                        (where most game drives take place) is renowned for having the greatest density
                                        of leopards per square kilometre in the world.

                                            Ruhuna National Park is usually hot and dry. The mean annual temperature is
                                            27 Celsius, although in the dry season the temperature could go as high as
                                            37 Celsius.

                                            The best time to visit is during the dry season, which lasts from May
                                            through September, and in early October,when the commencement of the drought

                                        Yala is all about convergence of magnificence and endurance, painting a picture
                                        of eternal beauty and mystery. It’s a vast deciduous forest where the land gives
                                        up its green top, exposing vast expanses of open terrain dotted with grasslands
                                        and shrubs, tanks and lagoons, water holes and sand dunes. Despite its lack of a
                                        thick forest cover, animals are still experts at taking cover from prying eyes.
